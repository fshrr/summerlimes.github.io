**Project Overview:**
Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Langchain to accelerate project-specific component generation, significantly reducing the time required for design to static site generation.

## Objectives

1. Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation of project-specific components.
2. Optimize the design to static site generation process to achieve faster turnaround times.
3. Streamline and automate the workflow for generating components, improving overall efficiency.

## Features

1. **RAG Integration:**

   - Implemented RAG in Langchain to facilitate the generation of components tailored to specific projects.
   - Utilized advanced retrieval techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of component creation.

2. **Accelerated Design Process:**

   - Reduced design to static site generation time by 40% through optimized component generation.
   - Leveraged Langchain's capabilities to automate and streamline the generation process.

3. **Optimized Workflow:**

   - Automated the retrieval and generation of project-specific components, minimizing manual intervention.
   - Enhanced the overall workflow, providing faster and more efficient static site generation.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Langchain
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Custom RAG implementation

## Outcome
