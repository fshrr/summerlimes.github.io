**Project Overview:**
Collaborated with the University of Toronto Daniels Faculty of Architecture and LAMAS to develop automated processes for building facade transformations, generate new architectural styles using neural style transfer, and create a web application for a student workshop.

## Objectives

1. Automate the transformation of 2D building facade features into 3D models using edge detection techniques.
2. Generate novel architectural facades by combining different styles or applying art styles to architecture through neural style transfer.
3. Develop a web application to run neural style transfers on student prompts using AWS GPU-enabled servers.

## Features

1. **2D to 3D Transformation:**

   - Automated edge detection to identify building facades.
   - Classified architectural types using Scikit-learn and Scikit-image.

2. **Neural Style Transfer:**

   - Created and labeled datasets for training neural style transfer models.
   - Used PyTorch and OpenCV to blend architectural styles and artistic influences.

3. **Web Application Development:**

   - Developed a Django web app for student workshops.
   - Managed load balancing and GPU instances on AWS for optimal performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** JavaScript
- **Backend:** Django, AWS
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Scikit-image, PyTorch, OpenCV

## Outcome

The project successfully automated the transformation of building facade features, generated unique architectural styles through neural style transfer, and provided a scalable web application for educational workshops.
